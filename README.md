# Doppl Fork

This is a fork of the Google Gson library to provide tests and modifications to support
iOS development with J2objc using the [Doppl build framework](http://doppl.co/).

## Versions

[2.6.2](https://github.com/doppllib/gson-forked-doppl/tree/dp-v2.6.2)

## Usage

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.6.2'
    doppl 'co.doppl.com.google.code.gson:gson:2.6.2.4'
}
```

## Status

Stable. No known memory issues. Minor test issues related to iOS/Java differences.

## Library Development

See [docs](http://doppl.co/docs/createlibrary.html) for an overview of our setup and repo org for forked library development.
